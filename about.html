      <h1 class="special-text">Hi again, I'm Will.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a web developer living in Crossville, Tennessee, interested in how
        people and software can work together to make life better. I'm currently
        doing freelance web development on the side, but while I'm at my full
        time job, I am a lab technician at Mizkan.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into web development began at age 15, with my father's boss
        asking me to create a website for his business. Eventually, this spark
        transformed into a fascination for how websites worked and a desire to
        create my own digital experiences. Over the years, I've honed my skills
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks like React. Each
        project I undertake is an opportunity to learn, innovate, and push the
        boundaries of what's possible on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer, I enjoy being a generalist with a focus on craft and
        prototyping. Inspiration and creation are at the heart of everything I
        do. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and turning
        ideas into reality. Whether it's developing a sleek portfolio site or a
        robust web application, I am committed to delivering exceptional results
        that exceed expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the opportunity to work on a handful of projects, primarily
        in front-end web development, such as for the non-profit organization
        AMCA (Asociación de Música Country Argentina/Argentina's Country Music
        Association.)

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I love medicine (I previously pursued a bachelor's
        degree with a major in pre-professional medicine in college) and I love
        connecting with nature and people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always excited to take on new projects and collaborate with
        like-minded individuals. If you're looking for a dedicated web developer
        to bring your ideas to life, let's connect and create something amazing
        together! Never hesitate to
